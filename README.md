My 'Hello World' repository

Since I'm the kind of person who appreciates meaningful symbolism, creating this repository feels important. Like the beginning of a new chapter for me, as I embark on the journey of becoming a developer. I'm starting on this journey a little later than most, but I've always identified with the likes of Harry Truman and Abraham Lincoln whose greatest achievement came later, after several decades of mediocrity.
